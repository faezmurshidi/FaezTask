Users can now choose between creating a new project by uploading a PRD or importing an existing .taskmaster project via a dedicated modal with clear visual cues and descriptions for each workflow. The import flow leverages native Electron folder selection, validates the .taskmaster structure, auto-populates project names, and provides step-by-step progress tracking. UI/UX improvements include conditional rendering, visual feedback for valid selections, comprehensive form validation, and accessibility enhancements. Electron integration was expanded with new APIs and IPC methods for folder selection and validation. Backend logic now cleanly separates new and existing project handlers, with clear TODOs for CLI integration. This update enables seamless onboarding for existing Task Master users and significantly broadens the app’s utility.\n</info added on 2025-06-16T09:04:39.015Z>",

        "description": "Develop an integrated terminal component within the application that allows users to execute command-line operations directly from the app interface.",
        "details": "Create a terminal component using node-pty for pseudo-terminal support and xterm.js for the frontend terminal interface. The terminal should support basic shell commands, provide command history, and integrate with the project's file system operations. Implement multiple terminal sessions/tabs functionality. Ensure proper security by sandboxing terminal operations and validating commands. Use libraries like xterm-addon-fit for responsive terminal sizing and xterm-addon-web-links for clickable links.\n<info added on 2025-06-17T01:59:04.414Z>\nImplementing an integrated terminal component in an Electron application using React requires careful consideration of both functionality and security. Below are best practices to guide the development process, focusing on security measures and support for multiple terminal sessions.\n\nTerminal Component Implementation\n\n1. Utilize `node-pty` and `xterm.js`:\n- `node-pty`: This library provides pseudo-terminal functionality, allowing the Electron app to spawn and manage terminal processes. It enables the execution of shell commands within the application.\n- `xterm.js`: A front-end component that renders the terminal interface in the browser. It supports features like command history and customizable themes, enhancing the user experience.\n\n2. Support Multiple Terminal Sessions:\n- Session Management: Implement logic to handle multiple terminal instances, allowing users to open, close, and switch between sessions seamlessly.\n- Tab Interface: Consider using a tabbed interface to manage multiple sessions, providing a familiar and organized user experience.\n\nSecurity Considerations\n\n1. Disable Node.js Integration in Renderer Processes:\n- Why: Allowing Node.js integration in renderer processes can expose the application to security risks, such as remote code execution.\n- How: Set `nodeIntegration` to `false` in the `webPreferences` of your `BrowserWindow` configuration.\n\n2. Enable Context Isolation:\n- Why: Context isolation ensures that the renderer's JavaScript context is separate from the preload script's context, preventing untrusted code from accessing privileged APIs.\n- How: Set `contextIsolation` to `true` in the `webPreferences` of your `BrowserWindow`.\n\n3. Implement Secure Inter-Process Communication (IPC):\n- Why: IPC is used for communication between the main and renderer processes. Without proper validation, it can be exploited to perform unauthorized actions.\n- How: Validate the `sender` of all IPC messages to ensure they originate from trusted sources.\n\n4. Define a Content Security Policy (CSP):\n- Why: A CSP helps prevent cross-site scripting (XSS) attacks by specifying which sources are allowed to load content.\n- How: Add a CSP meta tag to your application's HTML file.\n\n5. Sanitize User Input:\n- Why: To prevent injection attacks, it's crucial to sanitize all user inputs before processing them.\n- How: Use libraries like DOMPurify to clean user inputs.\n\n6. Regularly Update Dependencies:\n- Why: Keeping dependencies up-to-date ensures that known vulnerabilities are patched.\n- How: Use tools like `npm audit` to identify and fix security issues in your dependencies.\n\nIntegration with Project File System Operations\n\n1. Secure File System Access:\n- Why: Direct access to the file system can be exploited if not properly controlled.\n- How: Use Electron's `fs` module cautiously, ensuring that file operations are performed only when necessary and with proper validation.\n\n2. Implement Permission Checks:\n- Why: To prevent unauthorized access to sensitive files or directories.\n- How: Before performing file operations, check user permissions and validate file paths to ensure they are within allowed directories.\n\nTesting Strategy\n\n1. Test Terminal Initialization and Command Execution:\n- Objective: Ensure that the terminal component initializes correctly and executes commands as expected.\n- Approach: Write unit tests to simulate terminal initialization and command execution scenarios.\n\n2. Verify Multiple Session Management:\n- Objective: Confirm that multiple terminal sessions can be created, managed, and switched between without issues.\n- Approach: Implement integration tests that open multiple terminal sessions and perform operations in each.\n\n3. Validate Security Measures:\n- Objective: Ensure that security configurations like context isolation and CSP are correctly implemented.\n- Approach: Conduct security audits and penetration testing to identify and address potential vulnerabilities.\n\nBy adhering to these best practices, you can develop a secure and functional integrated terminal component within your Electron application, providing users with a robust and safe command-line interface experience.\n</info added on 2025-06-17T01:59:04.414Z>\n<info added on 2025-06-18T01:34:18.452Z>\nImplementing an integrated terminal within an Electron React application involves several key considerations: utilizing appropriate libraries for terminal emulation, managing multiple sessions, ensuring secure operations, and integrating with the file system. Below are best practices to guide this implementation:\n\n1. Utilizing `node-pty` and `xterm.js` for Terminal Emulation\n\n- `node-pty`: This library allows spawning pseudo-terminal processes, enabling the execution of shell commands within the application. It supports cross-platform compatibility, handling different shells like `bash` on Unix-based systems and `powershell.exe` on Windows.\n\n- `xterm.js`: A front-end terminal emulator that renders the terminal interface in the browser. It is highly customizable and integrates seamlessly with `node-pty` to display terminal output and capture user input.\n\nImplementation Steps:\n\n- Main Process: Initialize the pseudo-terminal using `node-pty` and set up communication channels between the main and renderer processes.\n\n- Renderer Process: Set up `xterm.js` to display the terminal and handle user input.\n\n2. Managing Multiple Terminal Sessions\n\nTo support multiple terminal sessions or tabs, maintain an array of `pty` processes and corresponding `xterm.js` instances. Assign unique identifiers to each session to manage them effectively.\n\nImplementation Steps:\n\n- Main Process: Manage multiple `pty` instances.\n\n- Renderer Process: Handle multiple `xterm.js` instances.\n\n3. Ensuring Security\n\nSecurity is paramount when integrating a terminal within an application, as it can execute arbitrary commands.\n\nBest Practices:\n\n- Disable Node.js Integration in Renderer: Set `nodeIntegration: false` and `contextIsolation: true` in the `BrowserWindow` configuration to prevent untrusted code from accessing Node.js APIs.\n\n- Use Preload Scripts: Expose only necessary APIs to the renderer process through a preload script.\n\n- Validate Commands: Implement validation and sanitization of commands to prevent injection attacks.\n\n- Sandboxing: Enable the sandbox to restrict the renderer process's capabilities.\n\n4. Integrating with the File System\n\nTo allow the terminal to interact with the application's file system, ensure that the `cwd` (current working directory) of the `pty` process is set appropriately.\n\nImplementation Steps:\n\n- Set Working Directory: When spawning the `pty` process, set the `cwd` to the desired directory.\n\n- File System Operations: For file operations initiated from the terminal, ensure that the application has the necessary permissions and that operations are performed securely.\n\nBy setting the correct working directory and managing permissions, the terminal can effectively interact with the project's file system.\n\nImplementing an integrated terminal in your Electron React application requires careful consideration of terminal emulation, session management, security, and file system integration. By adhering to these best practices, you can create a robust and secure terminal component that enhances your application's functionality.\n</info added on 2025-06-18T01:34:18.452Z>",
